#Leap motion control for Space Invaders

This project modifies a Space Invaders game to be controlled by a Leap motion,
using the player's wrist movement and 'gun firing' movement (kicking the index
finger upwards quickly).

This project was created as part of [HackIllinois 2015](hackillinois.org).
